Global Gesture-Controlled Car Using Arduino Nano BLE 33
Sense and MQTT Protocol
Abstract
This project explores the development of a Gesture-Controlled IoT Car, a significant
advancement in remote interaction technology. The system leverages the capabilities of
an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense [1] for gesture recognition and an Arduino Nano 33
IoT[2] for MQTT-based communication, with the two devices interconnected via I2C.
The project’s primary aim is to bridge geographical distances, allowing users to control
a remote car from anywhere in the world using intuitive hand gestures.
This report provides a detailed account of the project’s evolution, including its initial
concept, design gap analysis, and the actual implementation. It discusses the hardware and
software components used, the process of gesture recognition, and showcases the achieved
milestones with relevant images and diagrams. Challenges encountered during develop-
ment are addressed, and the influence of class readings and workshops on the project is
reflected upon.
The project highlights the synergy between IoT and Machine Learning, with potential
applications extending beyond remote control systems. It sets the stage for future research
in gesture-based IoT applications, opening doors to new possibilities in human-machine
interaction.
1 Introduction
In an era marked by the relentless pursuit of innovation and technology-driven solutions, this
report presents the creation of a Gesture-Controlled IoT Car project. It explores the fusion
of IoT and machine learning technologies to enable remote control of a car using hand ges-
tures. The project’s primary goal is to showcase the power of intuitive remote control, bridging
geographical distances and redefining human-machine interaction. It also delves into the in-
tegration of MQTT for real-time communication and motor control logic to execute gesture
commands.
